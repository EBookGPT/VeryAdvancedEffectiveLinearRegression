As we move further along in our journey towards mastering the art of linear regression, it is essential to continually evaluate and improve our models. In this chapter, we will delve into the modern methodologies for model evaluation and improvement, exploring the various techniques and tools at our disposal.

No discussion of modern methodologies for model evaluation and improvement would be complete without input from one of the foremost experts in machine learning today- Andrew Ng. His insights and experience in this field will prove invaluable as we explore some of the latest methodologies.

In this chapter, we will discuss various advanced techniques such as cross-validation and regularization that can help us improve the accuracy and efficiency of our models. We will also examine several popular techniques for evaluating the performance of our models, including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.

Lastly, we will explore the use of residual analysis to diagnose problems with our models and improve their accuracy. By the end of this chapter, you will have a deep understanding of the modern techniques and tools we can use to evaluate and improve our linear regression models. Let's dive in and uncover the secrets of modern linear regression methodologies, with the help of our esteemed guest, Andrew Ng.
Sherlock Holmes was called upon by a large internet retailer's CEO to investigate an issue. The company was spending a considerable amount of money on marketing promotions, and the CEO wanted to know if the marketing campaigns were profitable. The company had been keeping track of user behavior and purchases made during and after the promotional campaigns, but the CEO couldn't figure out how to interpret the data to answer his question.

Sherlock Holmes decided to enlist the help of Andrew Ng, who was familiar with modern methodologies for model evaluation and model improvement. Andrew suggested they use a technique known as cross-validation to evaluate the performance of their existing model. They discovered that there was a vast disparity in the accuracy of the model depending on the data used to train it, leading to poor predictions.

Sherlock then examined the data with the help of Andrew Ng and found that the problem was caused by overfitting. The model was too complex and was capturing noise in the data. To overcome this, they used regularization in the training process, ensuring that the model is not too complex, leading to better performance.

Next, they visualized the classification results, and Andrew recommended precision-recall curves as the best option to assess the model's performance since the positive class was imbalanced.

Finally, they used the residuals analysis to check if there were any data points that the model was not predicting correctly, and Andrew suggested addressing these by adding more relevant confusion data, which he claimed would improve the model's accuracy further.

In the end, Sherlock Holmes, together with Andrew Ng, showed the CEO how to use modern methodologies for model evaluation and model improvement to address the company's marketing campaign's profitability. They successfully reduced the cost of marketing campaigns by 40% while maintaining their previous profits. The CEO was delighted with the outcome and thanked Sherlock and Andrew for their remarkable work.
To resolve the mystery, Sherlock Holmes and Andrew Ng employed several modern methodologies for model evaluation and improvement. Here is an explanation of the code behind these methodologies:

1. Cross-Validation:

Cross-validation is used to evaluate the performance of a model. Here is some sample code for 10-fold cross-validation:

```
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

# Instantiate a Linear Regression object
lr = LinearRegression()

# Use 10-fold cross-validation for the training data
kf = KFold(n_splits=10, random_state=None, shuffle=True)
y_pred = cross_val_predict(lr, X_train, y_train, cv=kf)
```

2. Regularization:

Regularization helps to address the issue of overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The below sample code includes L1 and L2 regularization:

```
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

# Instantiate a Ridge regression object with alpha = 0.1
ridge = Ridge(alpha=0.1)

# Instantiate a Lasso regression object with alpha = 0.1
lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)

# Fit the Ridge and Lasso regression models
ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)
lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

3. Precision-Recall Curves:

Precision-recall curves are used to assess the performance of a classification model. Here is some sample code:

```
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_curve
from sklearn.metrics import plot_precision_recall_curve

# Instantiate a classification object
clf = LogisticRegression()

# Fit the classification model
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data and retrieve the decision function
y_score = clf.decision_function(X_test)

# Compute the precision and recall using the decision function
precision, recall, thresholds = precision_recall_curve(y_test, y_score)

# Plot the precision-recall curve
plot_precision_recall_curve(clf, X_test, y_test)
```

4. Residual Analysis:

Residual analysis is used to diagnose problems with our models and improve their accuracy. Here is some sample code:

```
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import metrics

# Instantiate a Linear Regression object
lr = LinearRegression()

# Fit the training data to the model
lr.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the test data and calculate the residuals
y_pred = lr.predict(X_test)
residuals = y_test - y_pred

# Plot a residual plot
plt.scatter(y_pred, residuals)
np.title('Residual Plot')
plt.xlabel('Predicted Values')
plt.ylabel('Residuals')
plt.show()
```

Using these modern methodologies for model evaluation and model improvement provided Sherlock Holmes and Andrew Ng with the necessary tools to resolve the mystery of the internet retailer's marketing campaign profitability, ultimately leading to a successful outcome.
